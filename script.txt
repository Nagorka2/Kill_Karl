ACT 1: The Death
Scene 1.1: F*ck Marry Kill
CHARACTERS: ARYA, CLEMENT
SETTING: Kitchen
(CLEMENT and ARYA are sitting on
the couch, during a party. CLEMENT
is evidently drunk and slurring his
words a little.)
CLEMENT
Wait, wait, wait. So JEREMY, KARL, and RAPHAEL ... who
would you fuck, marry, and kill?
ARYA
By fuck, you mean hold hands with, right?
CLEMENT
Uhm, yes, I’m sorry girl.
ARYA
Then I would hold hands with JEREMY.
CLEMENT
Wait! JEREMY? Eww! I thought you would say RAPHAEL for
sure.
ARYA
Yea, but I mean... I would marry RAPHAEL. I would even
hold hands with JEREMY, if that’s what it takes.
(gets nervous)
By the way, you can’t tell anyone! Nobody else knows
this.
CLEMENT
(gets very excited)
Oh my god girl, you and RAPHAEL? That’s so cute. I
promise, I won’t tell anyone. But isn’t he always
holding hands with KARL? It’s so loud every night, I hear
it in my nightmares. I can’t even sleep!
ARYA
(a bit sad)
Yes, but what can I do?
CLEMENT
1
Kill KARL?
ARYA
Kill KARL.
(Fade to black.)
Scene 1.2: The Party
CHARACTERS: CLEMENT, RAPHAEL, KARL
SETTING: Kitchen
(CLEMENT is sleeping on the couch
in a corner of the kitchen, wasted.
KARL and RAPHAEL walk into the
kitchen slightly tangled up in
each other, not noticing their
surroundings. They are preoccupied
with each other as they walk through
the door.)
RAPHAEL
(walking into the room laughing)
I told you no one would be here! My room wasn’t the mood
for what we’re going to do.
(winks seductively)
KARL
No, I get it! At least there’s no one here and it’s
quiet, we can do whatever we want. But wait, do you have
any protection?
RAPHAEL
Of course! I always bring some extra gloves with me.
(puts on a glove)
Now come here, I want to hold your hands like there’s no
tomorrow.
(They start to make out (aka holding
hands) and they make their way to
the couch to have some comfort while
doing the deed. RAPHAEL sits on
CLEMENT by accident. He freaks out,
causing KARL to scream out loud in a
stereotypically girly manner.)
RAPHAEL
What the heck? What are you doing here? The party’s
2
over, girl.
CLEMENT
(clearly drowsy and drunk)
I’m sleeping here, dude stop your obnoxious screaming,
you’re giving me a headache, and go do whatever horny
stuff you wanted to do somewhere else.
KARL
Dude, just go to your room and sleep it off, you’re
classier than this.
CLEMENT
(suddenly feels the urge to puke.
Puts his hand on his mouth)
Oh my god I need to puke.
(runs out)
(KARL and RAPHAEL continue their
business.)
KARL
Good riddance, took him long enough to get the memo.
Let’s get back to business, shall we?
(smirks salaciously)
(The lights dim down, the characters
are assumed to do the deed, after
which the lights come back up and
the two characters are sitting next
to each other, their hands slightly
touching.)
RAPHAEL
You’re as good as always, KARL. Let’s do this again soon,
shall we? Don’t keep me waiting like last time, okay?
Gotta keep my hands warm, you know.
KARL
(slightly out of breath)
That was amazing! Come to me with those strong hands
whenever you need it baby.
RAPHAEL
I’ll go to bed, are you coming? I wanna cuddle with
someone right now and I’d prefer if it were with you.
KARL
3
I’ll grab a bite first, you go ahead.
RAPHAEL
Alrighty, good night then.
(Strokes KARL ’s hand while getting
up. Then leaves.)
(KARL hums a song extremely out of
tune (he’s tone deaf) while looking
through his cupboard. The lights
dim, a clear thud is heard (sounds
like a human falling).)
Scene 1.3: The Death
CHARACTERS: KARL, JEREMY, CLEMENT, ARYA, RAPHAEL
SETTING: Kitchen
(Next morning. The lights slowly
fade in. The body of KARL is lying
on the floor.
ENTER JEREMY. When he sees the dead
body, he pokes it, with no reaction
from the body. He recoils, then
starts to rearrange the body. Then
he rearranges the pillows on the
couch, then leaves.
EXIT JEREMY. Wait for a bit.
ENTER CLEMENT.)
CLEMENT
(screaming)
But mum! I can’t keep living like this! ... no, don’t
put dad on the phone ... I just need a few more krona to
pass the week ... well, yes I did order new valentino
shoes, I can’t go around with the ones I have, it’s
soooo last season. ... so you expect me to live like
an animal?
(He finally sees the body and sighs)
Mum, I will call you later, the dirty boy is sleeping on
the floor again.
(He starts kicking the body trying to
wake him up)
KARL I’ve told you before, sleep on the couch not the
floor! KARL!
(he thinks he’s dead and screams)
ARYA
4
(enters the kitchen after hearing the
scream)
What is going on? Are you okay?
CLEMENT
(shaking, slowly pointing a finger at
KARL)
He... he... I think he’s not breathing.
ARYA
(approaches the body to find a pulse)
Oh my god he doesn’t have a pulse. He is dead!
RAPHAEL
(entering the room after hearing the
commotion)
Who is dead?
(sees the body)
Oh no, sweety.
ARYA
We need to call the police
(starts dialling the number)
RAPHAEL
(looking at CLEMENT)
I’m gonna miss his grip.
CLEMENT
Eww Raphael. I’m out of here, this place is the worst!
(grabs his cookies, looks at the
audience and leaves the kitchen)
RAPHAEL
I’ll have to agree with you on that darling.
(follows him out)
ARYA
(half crying)
hi? Police? There is a dead body in our kitchen. ...
no, I couldn’t find a pulse ... yes, the address is...
mhmm.
(EXIT ARYA.)
5
Scene 1.4: Life goes on (for
now)
CHARACTERS: JEREMY, CLEMENT, ARYA, RAPHAEL
SETTING: Kitchen
(The body is still on the floor.)
ARYA
I think we could all use some distraction right now. I
think I’m starving.
(calls to everyone from the empty
kitchen)
Is anyone hungry?
RAPHAEL
How could anyone eat right now? I haven’t even had
breakfast. And breakfast is the most important meal of
the day, that’s what you always say Arya... especially
after putting in the work last night.
CLEMENT
Eww!
RAPHAEL
You know what I’m talking about.
(says to CLEMENT, puts his arm around
ARYA.)
ARYA
Not now Raphael!
CLEMENT
Whatever. ARYA, when will the police get here? Looking
at this body
(throws blanket at the body)
reminds me that I’m ageing, which makes me worried,
which gives me wrinkles, which reminds me that I’m ageing
again. It’s a vicious cycle.
ARYA
They said it could take a while, apparently all
detectives are tied up in a tricky bike theft
investigation right now. They take that seriously
here.
CLEMENT
Ugh.
6
(rolls his eyes)
Why does anyone care about that? Bikes belong in spin
class. God gave us Lamborghinis to get to places.
RAPHAEL
(gives him a sarcastic look)
Right.
ARYA
CLEMENT, didn’t your parents cut you off?
CLEMENT
Well yea. But I’ve got it taken care of. It’s 2024, a
boy can make his own money. YEAH!
(does a hair flick)
Let me know when the police get here.
(throws some kisses in the air
towards ARYA and RAPHAEL
EXIT CLEMENT.)
(JEREMY enters the kitchen with a
mop/broom, cleaning as he goes. He
is very systematic about it, going in
a precise pattern.)
ARYA
The routine must go on, huh? Would you like some help,
JEREMY?
JEREMY
(reaches RAPHAEL and ARYA in his
cleaning and stops in front of them,
speaks in a neutral tone)
No, I’m good. But you 3 are in the way.
ARYA
Okay okay, let’s make some space. I need to get
groceries anyways. RAPHAEL, will you help me carry?
RAPHAEL
Sure, I should go back to studying, but you know I’ll
take any excuse.
(EXIT ARYA and RAPHAEL. JEREMY goes
on in his cleaning in a suspicious
way side eyeing the audience.
EXIT JEREMY.)

Scene 1.5: Start of
Investigation
CHARACTERS: DMITRY, ALICE, ARYA, Police staff
SETTING: Kitchen
(Police staff secures the scene by
putting up yellow tape. As they
put up yellow tape, JEREMY keeps
taking it down. He is eventually
apprehended. Only ARYA remains at
the scene. As police staff gather
evidence and take pictures, the two
main investigators (DMITRY and ALICE)
approach ARYA, who is standing right
outside the yellow tape.)
ALICE
So where do we start? -
DMITRY
(sighs)
Aren’t you supposed to know that?
ALICE
Well I was thinking maybe you have your own way of doing
things and I don’t want to get in your way andARYA
Thank god you’re finally here!
DMITRY
(Nods with a tough bored batman-ish
look on his face.)
ALICE
Hello! Nice to meet you, I’m Alice Liddell.
(Shakes ARYA ’s hand very
enthusiastically)
DMITRY
Detective DMITRY Popov at your service. So KARL Hoffmann
was found here by who? And when was it?
ARYA
Well it was just this morning. Everyone and I got up as
usual. We always have breakfast together, it’s really
important to me.
8
ALICE
Interesting! You know I also think breakfast is the most
important meal of the day and when you can share it, it’s
even better.
ARYA
Yes exactly, we all have such hectic days, but at least
we can all start the day with each other.
DMITRY
(Coughs)
ALICE
Ah! Sorry.
DMITRY
When was the victim found and by whom, Miss.
ARYA
I think CLEMENT found him first, but I don’t know for
certain if anyone came before or not. We found him this
morning.
DMITRY
(nods in silence, then says to ALICE)
Well anyways, I think that we’re done here for now. You
order the autopsy, and then we’ll start getting to the
bottom of what happened here.
(EXIT everyone, Fade to black.)
ACT 2: First Interrogations
Scene 2.1: The awakening
CHARACTERS: KARL, Police staff
SETTING: Kitchen
(The body is still on the floor.
KARL is lying next to it and slowly
gets up, not realising he’s dead.)
KARL
(Yawns, facing the audience)
When did I fall asleep? Can’t remember a thing about
last night.
(Turns around after a second and sees
his own body. Yells in surprise.
Then looks around.)
9
What is this? Is this some kind of prank?
(Sarcastically)
Ha Ha, very funny guys.
(Takes a closer look at the body,
talking to himself)
Damn, they really did a good job with this dummy, it
looks so real.
(Picks up the dummy, and goes closer
to the audience facing them. Then
puts the head of the dummy next to
his)
Look! The similarity is uncanny! It could be my twin!
(Looks at the dummy, pensative and
confused)
Wait, who am I talking to? I think CLEMENT’s cookies
were extra strong last night.
(Shakes it off, puts the body back
where it was.)
(Police extras come into the room to
take the body away.)
KARL
(To himself)
Oh shit.
(To them)
Hello officers, what is going on? I haven’t done
anything wrong, have I?
(Police extras don’t notice him)
Hello?
(Police extras grab the body)
Hey! That’s not yours! What are you doing?
(No response, KARL gets annoyed)
Yuuuuhuuu, anyone home? Why are you ignoring me?
(he waves in front of their face)
What’s going on?
Police extra 1
Such a shame, he had so much life to live left.
Police extra 2
Yes... and it’s always the pretty ones...
Police extra 1
Oh well, what are ya gonna do. Let’s go.
(The police people are very squeamish
about touching the body. They exit
10
with the body. KARL is in shock as
he watches them leave with his body.)
Police extra 1
(Exhausted and scared, comes back.)
Oh my god. I need to make a tea.
(Opens the kitchen cabinet and looks
through it a bit.)
They have no tea! What kind of people have no tea at
home?
(Police extra 2 brings the body’s
outline and they both exit.)
KARL
Wait... nooo, no, no, no, no... am I... am I dead?!
(to the police extras)
Wait, come back! I have questions...
(pauses, looking at the audience)
I’m really dead aren’t I?!
(pauses again, thinking to himself)
But wait... if I’m dead and that was my body, then how
am I still here?
(long pause, thinking hard)
How the hell did that happen?!
Scene 2.2: ARYA ’s Interrogation
CHARACTERS: ARYA, DMITRY, ALICE, KARL
SETTING: Kitchen / Police station
(KARL is now a ghost, roaming
somewhere, invisible to the other
characters. ALICE is walking on
scene with ARYA and shows her where
to sit.)
KARL
Arya I’ve been following you all around the apartment,
please answer me!
ALICE
Please sit here, miss. My colleague will be with us any
second. Would you like some water in the meantime?
ARYA
(a bit uncomfortably)
No, thank you.
11
(ENTER DMITRY. ALICE sits down at the
table, opposite ARYA. DMITRY does not
sit, but leans on the table with his
hands, facing ARYA.)
ALICE
(relieved, as DMITRY walks in)
There you are!
(KARL waves to DMITRY with excitement
and starts mimicking his walk.)
DMITRY
(nods to ALICE, then takes a short,
uncomfortable break)
So, Miss, I hope inspector Liddel has offered you some
water. I always have to get my own, but then again, I am
not under interrogation, am I? On that topic, where were
you last night?
ARYA
I was at the party with everyone else. But I didn’t kill
KARL, I would never do such a thing. None of us in the
corridor would. Do you think I did it?
ALICE
That’s just a routine question, don’t worry.
DMITRY
Hmmph. We still need to ask it. And at what time did
you go to bed that night?
ARYA
I went to bed around 10pm. My plan was to study today
for my exams.
ALICE
(nostalgic)
Oh exams, I used to go to bed early as well to study.
(snaps out of the nostalgia)
Anyways. Miss, could you tell us a little bit about
KARL and who he was close with or if he possibly had any
issues with your corridor mates?
ARYA
Umm. KARL was nice. He got on people’s nerves sometimes
and he left
(emphasis "a lot")
12
A LOT of dishes in the sink,
(KARL gasps, visibly offended by
this)
He would leave his dirty underwear all over, my dad
visited me a couple of months ago and KARL was constantly
trying to hit on him! But everyone still got along. I
don’t think he had any problems. Unless
(pauses)
he did sometimes get some of those
(makes air quotes)
special cookies from CLEMENT, but I’m sure it’s
nothing.
DMITRY
Aha! Special cookies you say. Doesn’t exactly sound
like nothing to me. Tell us more about that.
ARYA
(gasp)
Oh no! I think I’ve said too much already.
(sits nervously on her hands)
I really don’t know anything about this.
KARL
Sure you don’t.
DMITRY
Sure sure, that’s what I would say if I were you.
ALICE
Okay, thank you Miss. DMITRY, do we have any other
questions?
DMITRY
What does your intuition tell you?
ALICE
My intuition says no, that’s why I ask you. But oh well.
Thank you for your time, Miss. Please get in touch with
us if you think of anything else.
ARYA
Thank you, I will.
(EXIT ARYA.)
ALICE
So these special cookies, huh? This CLEMENT is looking
13
quite suspicious..
DMITRY
I suppose so. You can go bring him in.
(EXIT ALICE. KARL keeps mocking and
mimicking DMITRY.)
Scene 2.3: CLEMENT’s
Interrogation
CHARACTERS: DMITRY, ALICE, CLEMENT, KARL
SETTING: Kitchen / Police station
(DMITRY is sitting, KARL is roaming
somewhere. ALICE and CLEMENT
enter the scene and sit at the
table. CLEMENT sits opposite to the
detectives. ALICE hears KARL but
does her best to not react.)
ALICE
(To CLEMENT, attempting to offer
comfort)
You seem stressed. Please, don’t be! We just want to
ask you a few questions, just trying to piece together
what happened.
CLEMENT
(Looks at her surprised and after a
few seconds bursts into laughter)
Oh, honey, but I’m not stressed because of you... I
couldn’t care less about KARL and that he is dead. If
I am stressed, I am for myself. What if the murderer
kills me next?! Also, I just realised I reserved a table
at that super exclusive celebrity-only restaurant, and I
have no idea what to wear.
(Both officers and KARL stare
surprised at CLEMENT ’s shallowness)
KARL
(shaking his head)
Oh boy, this will take a while. I’m actually glad that
I’m dead. Good luck!
DMITRY
Let’s cut the crap! Where were you last night and most
14
importantly... Did you kill the guy?!
KARL
(Amused, says to himself)
Yeah, right. CLEMENT would hurt someone else only if
they were to ruin his designer bag or something.
ALICE
(takes a deep breath and says to
DMITRY)
Uhm...sir?
DMITRY
(Ignores ALICE completely)
Ey? Pretty boy with rich parents. I bet you’ve always
used your tears to get whatever you want. For once, keep
your feet on the ground and share all the details about
last night. Or did you eat too many cookies and don’t
remember much?
(ALICE is upset because DMITRY
ignored her completely and he doesn’t
even care. KARL sees that. CLEMENT
is also mad at DMITRY because he is
rude.)
CLEMENT
What’s there to say? It was a lame party, I obviously
left early. Do I seem like someone who’d enjoy that kind
of gathering? A skilled detective would’ve known from
the start that I only go to good parties where only the
best is served, if you know what I mean.
(winks at him)
(DMITRY, ALICE, and KARL are face
slapping themselves. DMITRY,
annoyed, gets up and wanders the
room.)
ALICE
(Smiles at CLEMENT)
I think we have everything we needed. You can go and
thank you for your time!
CLEMENT
(stands up and goes towards the door
to leave the kitchen. He stops,
looks at them and says)
15
Of course! Bye! You should definitely check that JEREMY
guy.
(Makes big eyes)
He is a freak!
(CLEMENT starts to walk towards the
exit.)
ALICE
What do you mean?
(DMITRY, still up, pays attention to
what CLEMENT has to say. KARL too.)
CLEMENT
Well, I was in the Bahamas some time back. I had to
leave the island early though, and when I got back, he
was in my room!
ALICE
What happened?
CLEMENT
(takes deep breath and shakes
his head, looks to the left as he
remembers something, and then stares
with a serious face at ALICE)
I caught my boyfriend liking other girls’ pictures on
Instagram, so I chose to end things with him then and
there!
(now smiles, proud of herself)
And I may or may not have taken his passport with me,
leaving him there by himself.
(now, back with a serious face)
No. One. Cheats. On. Clement! Yeah, I’m the big boy
here
(KARL, already used to CLEMENT
thinking only about herself, rolls
his eyes.)
ALICE
I meant what happened with JEREMY...
CLEMENT
Oh, he was in my room, going through my stuff, doing his
weird thing.
16
ALICE
Could you be more specific?
CLEMENT
Cleaning and throwing away my drugs,uhm
(stops a bit)
stuff.
DMITRY
What was the first thing?
CLEMENT
Stuff
DMITRY
Interesting, stuff, Liddle, write that down
(DMITRY and ALICE make eye contact
and keep the contact for a few
seconds. CLEMENT pulls out a
lipstick out of his bag and uses
it. DMITRY opens the door for him.
ALICE, still sitting at the table,
watches him as he goes. When CLEMENT
reaches the door, he stops suddenly.)
CLEMENT
Actually, I don’t cross paths with detectives on a daily
basis, so I see this as an opportunity. I’m currently
dating a few guys, and I was wondering which one is
wealthier? Can you help me?
DMITRY
(doing his absolute best to keep his
cool)
No...
(CLEMENT, upset, leaves. DMITRY
closes the door. ALICE and DMITRY
make eye contact and both of them
exhale, frustrated. DMITRY sits
back at the table next to ALICE. KARL
takes CLEMENT ’s seat and puts his
head on his palms and looks at the
detectives, enjoying their pain. In
parallel, ALICE talks to DMITRY and
listens to what KARL is saying.)
17
KARL
So, who’s the next suspect?
ALICE
(to DMITRY)
So, who’s the next suspect?
KARL
Hey! Don’t copy me!
DMITRY
Anyone will be better than this boy.
KARL
(laughing)
wait till you meet JEREMY!
ALICE
Let’s continue with JEREMY! I’ll go get him.
(ALICE ignores KARL and leaves the
room to get JEREMY. While she is
gone, KARL and DMITRY wait in the
kitchen. KARL decides to mess more
with DMITRY, for his own amusement.)
Scene 2.4: Interrogation -
JEREMY
CHARACTERS: JEREMY, ALICE, DMITRY
SETTING: Kitchen / Police station
(ALICE enters first and stands next
to DMITRY. JEREMY enters the room
right after, looking around the room
suspiciously.)
ALICE
Hello JEREMY, have a seat. Would you like to have a cup
of water?
JEREMY
No thanks, I carry my own cup all the time.
(He takes out a small portable cup)
CLEMENT was sitting here right?
ALICE
(perplexed)
18
Yes.
JEREMY
Right.
(Before sitting, JEREMY takes out
wet wipes to clean the chair and the
table. This goes on for a while,
until DMITRY loses his patience.)
DMITRY
(obviously annoyed)
Ohh please, do sit down!
(JEREMY sits down.)
DMITRY
We have a few questions we would like to ask you. First
of all, what is your relationship with the victim?
JEREMY
Well, it wasn’t good.
DMITRY
Why do you say that?
JEREMY
He was always so dirty. We even had a fight when
he caught me cleaning his room. And then there’s
Bubbles...
ALICE
Bubbles?
JEREMY
My only companion, my confidant, my best friend. I can’t
shake the feeling that KARL had something to do with his
disappearance.
DMITRY
Wait a second, you mentioned you had a fight with the
victim, what was that about?
JEREMY
As I said, I was just in his room one day he was away and
he lost it when he caught me cleaning it.
ALICE
19
Why did you do that?
JEREMY
I do that for everyone. I don’t understand why they
should be annoyed about that, I was doing them a favor.
ALICE
Well my mom does that, and I like it. I love the smell
of fresh lemon when I enter my room.
(JEREMY looks at ALICE like he is in
love.)
DMITRY
ALICE what the heck are you talking about?
(looks back at JEREMY)
When did KARL catch you in his private room, and how did
you enter the room?
JEREMY
(totally cool and chill)
Well, it was two weeks ago. He had gone to the
supermarket because he had run out of cheese, shampoo,
pasta and I think chicken so I knew he would be missing
for an hour at least. So I entered the room and I
started cleaning it. But he caught me while I was
cleaning the toilet. You see, he had forgotten his
phone.
(JEREMY and ALICE look disappointed)
DMITRY
But how did you enter the room?
JEREMY
Ah, I have a key, obviously.
ALICE
You do?
JEREMY
Yes, I have a key for everyone’s room.
(he takes out a big key chain with a
lot of keys)
I made copies.
DMITRY
What is your problem son?
(left almost speechless)
20
JEREMY
Do you know how unsanitary this building is? For
example, do you know how many used gloves RAPHAEL has
under his bed from holding hands with people? You don’t
want to know.
ALICE
(empathize with JEREMY)
Ohh what your eyes have seen... That sounds very hard.
JEREMY
You have no idea. Like, the other day I saw RAPHAEL
chasing KARL with a metallic toy hand. KARL was yelling
"NO WAY, it’s so cold!".
DMITRY
I’m sorry what?
JEREMY
You see my point now. Do you know how many germs are on
a glove that’s been used to hold hands?
DMITRY
(exhausted)
Matter of fact, I do. We get a lot of those as evidence.
But I think that is enough for now. You can go now.
ALICE, could you get RAPHAEL? And JEREMY, please leave
the keys here.
JEREMY
But I need them, there are more places that need to be
cleaned.
DMITRY
Do you think that I care?
(JEREMY leaves the Keys
disappointedly.
EXIT JEREMY and ALICE.)
Scene 2.5: RAPHAEL’s
Interrogation
CHARACTERS: RAPHAEL, ALICE, DMITRY, KARL
SETTING: Kitchen / Police Station
(KARL is on stage, doing his thing,
invisible to everyone else. DMITRY
21
is sitting at the table.
ENTER ALICE.)
DMITRY
Where is RAPHAEL?
ALICE
He was in the toilet, he’s on his way.
(Awkward silence.)
ALICE
So
(awkward pause)
this is the final corridor mate we’re interviewing,
huh?
DMITRY
Yup.
(More awkward silence.)
(ENTER RAPHAEL.)
ALICE
Hello, please take a seat.
RAPHAEL
(takes a seat)
Thank you. Man this whole thing is a tragedy. Have you
gotten anywhere with the case so far?
DMITRY
When there is something to know, we will let you
know. But this is an interrogation, so we will ask the
questions.
(short pause)
We gather that you saw the victim yesterday night at this
party, correct?
RAPHAEL
Yes.
DMITRY
And were you alone with the victim during that night?
RAPHAEL
Yes I was, we were holding hands on the couch after the
22
party, CLEMENT actually saw us. But I went to my room
afterwards and I didn’t see KARL after that,
(gets emotional)
only when CLEMENT found him. I can’t believe he’s
dead.
DMITRY
Aha, so you and the victim were holding hands, huh?
Isn’t that interesting.
(pause)
Did you ever get jealous because of him?
RAPHAEL
(shocked)
I... did I...? Get jealous? Why would I get jealous?
ALICE
It’s okay, take your time RAPHAEL.
RAPHAEL
No seriously, why would I ever get jealous?
(ALICE and DMITRY give each other and
the audience confused looks.)
KARL
You see, these two are confused, because they don’t know
that RAPHAEL not only held hands with me, but also ARYA,
CLEMENT, and his half sister’s cousin’s best friend.
DMITRY
Well, maybe KARL wanted to hold hands with someone else
and you couldn’t deal with it.
ALICE
There can be many reasons to be jealous of someone.
RAPHAEL
Well I don’t get jealous. And our situation was super
casual anyways, I didn’t even care about KARL. We were
just chilling.
(KARL seems upset that RAPHAEL didn’t
even care about him.)
ALICE
No cap?
23
RAPHAEL
No cap.
DMITRY
Can you stop speaking in codes?
ALICE
Sorry. It sounds like he really had a good relationship
with the victim.
RAPHAEL
Not a relationship, oh my god!
ALICE
Don’t worry about it. And thank you RAPHAEL, we will be
in touch if we need to know anything else.
DMITRY
Wait, before you go. JEREMY mentioned something
about KARL being responsible for his best friend’s
disappearance, what was that about?
ALICE
I think he said it was Bubbles, sir.
RAPHAEL
Oh my god I can’t believe he is still upset about that.
Look, Bubbles was JEREMY’s goldfish. One time me and
KARL were messing around and I dared him to eat it, as a
joke. Next thing I know, Bubbles went missing.
ALICE
Wait, you think KARL eat Bubbles?
RAPHAEL
I mean, it’s KARL we’re talking about...
DMITRY
Ok, I think we heard enough. You’re free to leave now
son.
RAPHAEL
Okay, no problem.
(EXIT RAPHAEL.)
24
Scene 2.6: KARL ’s return
CHARACTERS: ALICE, DMITRY, KARL
SETTING: Kitchen / Police station
(ALICE, DMITRY and KARL are the only
ones left on stage.)
KARL
I can’t believe they would all say such things.
DMITRY
I think I’m done for the day, I’m gonna head back to
headquarters.
(leaves the room, leaving ALICE
alone)
ALICE
(to KARL)
don’t you ever shut up?!
KARL
Wait, can you see me?
ALICE
AND hear you, which I wish I couldn’t. So what do you
want? What are you doing here? Who was your killer?
KARL
Woo woo, what’s with all of the questions? You’re
clearly a capable investigator, why don’t YOU tell me?
No, seriously, tell me because I have no idea.
ALICE
what do you mean, you don’t know who killed you? How is
that possible?!
KARL
Look, all I can remember is having a great time with
RAPHAEL after the party, and then I went to grab a bite
and everything went black. When I woke up I saw myself
on the floor and I thought I was dreaming. I tried
talking to my friends but no one could hear or see me.
(starts speaking faster, blabbering)
And now I don’t even think I can call them friends
anymore because apparently one of them hated me enough
to kill me and now I’m DEAD?!!
(hyperventilating)
25
ALICE
(trying to calm him down)
okay KARL, deep breaths. I can imagine this is a
difficult situation for you, but I think the reason why
you’re stuck here is because you need to know who killed
you. I can help you with that.
KARL
But where do we even begin? I had no idea any of them
thought all those things about me.
ALICE
Surely you have some suspicions, right? I mean, they
all seem pretty convinced you weren’t the most pleasant
person to live with.
KARL
(defensively)
Oh, come on! I was just a bit messy, a free spirit.
It’s not like I murdered anyone.
ALICE
No, but maybe your lifestyle irritated someone enough to
push them over the edge. I mean, who would benefit from
getting rid of you?
KARL
Well, there’s JEREMY. He always complained about my
messiness. Maybe he just couldn’t take it anymore.
ALICE
Messiness alone doesn’t usually drive someone to murder.
(KARL pokes his nose. ALICE looks at
him with a disgusted face)
well, I guess in your case it would be possible. What
about RAPHAEL? You mentioned having a great time with him
before everything went black.
KARL
RAPHAEL? Nah, we were just having a good time holding
hands. He’s not the killer type.
(pauses, looking thoughtful)
Well, there was this one time when CLEMENT got super
mad because I left some of my food on his shelf in the
fridge. He went on and on about how disgusting it was.
ALICE
(nodding)
26
That could be a starting point, I guess? I still don’t
think it would be reason enough to kill you, but I’ll
ask him about it later, as well as questioning JEREMY
further.
KARL
(sarcastically)
Great, another round of people hating on me.
Wonderful.
(Fade to black.)
ACT 3: The investigation heats
up
Scene 3.1: Pasta is Life
CHARACTERS: ALICE, KARL
SETTING: Kitchen
(KARL and ALICE are in the kitchen,
chatting.)
KARL
Dude you keep asking me, but I swear, I didn’t see
anything.
ALICE
Don’t call me dude, please. But I believe you. Forget
I asked again, I’m sorry. What’s it like, being a ghost
anyway? Must be scary.
KARL
It’s scary alright. But also scary-cool. I’ve never
been able to make so much fun of everyone around me, and
they don’t even notice. Except you, of course.
(noticeably sad)
But to be honest, I miss eating. A lot.
ALICE
Oh god I can imagine. Did you have a favourite dish?
Mine’s Kladdkaka.
(dreams of kladdkaka)
KARL
(looking like he is thinking very
seriously, contemplating the taste of
food)
Mmh yes Kladdkaka is nice, but I’ve never really had a
27
sweet tooth.
(a small pause)
I really love pasta! I’ll eat anything if there’s pasta
in it.
(very convincing expression)
Meatballs for example, or potatoes, or Paella.
ALICE
(surprised, confused)
Wait, there is no pasta in Paella, what are you talking
about?
KARL
(proud face)
There is when I make it. There’s pasta in everything I
cook. It’s kind of revolutionary, literally everything
tastes good if you put pasta in it. Wanna eat the
perfect burger? Pasta. Got an old Tupperware in the
fridge and you forgot what’s in it? Pasta. Your friend
made a curry that’s way too spicy? Pasta. Pasta is
love. Pasta is life.
ALICE
(visibly disgusted)
Oh dear... You have a problem. Have you tried all of
those? Even the old Tupperware?
KARL
Of course, I did that all the time. I never threw away
food, that’s such a waste.
ALICE
Okay I guess, you do you. Hey, psst, DMITRY is coming,
act normal.
KARL
(with confusion)
He can’t see me.
ALICE
I was talking to myself!
(ALICE starts pretending like she was
inspecting something in the Kitchen.)
28
Scene 3.2: A New Motive
CHARACTERS: DMITRY, ALICE, KARL
SETTING: Kitchen
(ALICE and KARL are in the Kitchen
from the previous scene. ALICE
is trying to act normal, like she
doesn’t see KARL.
ENTER DMITRY.)
DMITRY
Oh good, you’re here. I wanted to talk to you. I think
we’re missing something in this case, but I can’t put my
finger on it.
ALICE
(still acting weird)
Yup, totally what I was thinking. That’s why I came
back here by myself, to see if we missed something on the
crime scene. But it looks clean.
DMITRY
(not paying attention to ALICE)
Five students live together and suddenly one is murdered
in their sleep. And of course these young people these
days, you know, they all seem to hate living with each
other, but still they hold hands with each other like
otters. It’s all so tangled. When I was your age, you
got a murder case like this and you knew immediately that
it was the partner. It was always the partner. Now this
RAPHAEL kid seems the least suspicious of all.
ALICE
(got back her composure)
You’re right, RAPHAEL seems innocent. We need to look at
this from a different angle.
DMITRY
Yes, it’s time to dig deeper, scrutinise alibis, and
unearth hidden clues. The answer lies within these
walls. I just need to unravel the mystery. Here’s a
question: Who has the most to lose?
KARL
Maybe the guy who’s dead lost the most already?!
ALICE
29
(annoyed look at KARL)
You think the killer was afraid of something?
DMITRY
Yes. Maybe this wasn’t done out of anger, but out of
fear. But fear of what?
ALICE
Fear of being discovered? Fear of losing something?
Fear of losing someone?
KARL
(continues ALICE ’s list)
I’m in fear of losing my mind here. Fear of never
knowing who killed me. Fear of being the annoying ghost
with unfinished business forever.
DMITRY
What was the first one?
ALICE
Fear of losing something?
DMITRY
No no, the other one.
ALICE
Fear of being discovered.
DMITRY
Yes! Fear of being discovered! What if KARL knew
something, and someone really didn’t want him to blab
about it. But what kind of secrets do these kids have?
KARL
(with irony)
I know your secret, you imposter for a detective. But
don’t worry, I won’t tell anyone, cause they can’t hear
me.
ALICE
Do you remember what ARYA said in our first
interrogation? She mentioned something about CLEMENT
having special cookies.
(ALICE gets more and more annoyed
at KARL, but tries to hide it from
DMITRY.)
30
DMITRY
Oh yes! That could be something! They must have had a
fight and KARL threatened that he’d rat him out. Maybe
he stopped giving him the cookies and he couldn’t handle
it.
KARL
(very annoyed)
I couldn’t handle it?? I can’t handle you anymore!
(EXIT KARL.)
Scene 3.3: Special Cookies
CHARACTERS: ALICE, DMITRY, CLEMENT
SETTING: Kitchen
(ALICE and DMITRY are in the kitchen
from the last scene. ENTER CLEMENT.)
DMITRY
(under his breath)
Speak of the devil.
CLEMENT
What?
DMITRY
(coughs)
Nothing. Come in pretty boy, I hope we’re not in the
way.
CLEMENT
Ugh. You are in the way, but it’s fine. I can handle
it. Have you found the killer yet?
ALICE
No, I’m afraid we haven’t. The investigation is ongoing,
but we will let you know as soon as possible, when we
find something out.
CLEMENT
(melodramatically)
So I need to keep living in fear.
DMITRY
Yes. Sure. Excuse me, but would you mind me using the
bathroom here? The station ran out of toilet paper.
31
Budget cuts in the department, you know.
CLEMENT
(rolls his eyes)
Whatever.
(EXIT DMITRY.)
CLEMENT
(does something in the kitchen,
ignoring ALICE for an awkward while,
before saying)
So who do you suspect, hmm?
ALICE
(nervously)
I’m really not supposed to say.
CLEMENT
Oh come on girl, you can tell me. You spill your tea, I
spill mine.
ALICE
(with a bit more confidence)
I... need to hear yours first though.
CLEMENT
Oh you’re clever, girl. Okay.
(smiles secretively)
I know who found KARL’s body before me. He even tried to
blackmail me not to tell anyone.
(ENTER DMITRY. ALICE was about to
respond, but is cut off by DMITRY.
He is holding a plastic baggy of
cookies.)
DMITRY
I’m very sorry, I must have taken the wrong door there
unfortunately. But look what I found. Would you like to
explain?
(ALICE gasps.)
CLEMENT
Ugh! Who do you even think you are?
DMITRY
32
I’m the police. And I just found these special cookies
in your room.
CLEMENT
Uuuuhm... They’re not mine?
DMITRY
Try again, pretty boy.
CLEMENT
Yes ok, they might be mine. But I swear these are the
only ones I have.
(Talking to himself)
KARL made sure of that.
ALICE
What did you just say?
CLEMENT
Look, I didn’t want to mention it before because I don’t
like speaking ill of the dead. But KARL was not only
dirty and annoying, he was also a thief. If I’m almost
bankrupt is because of him. I had a good thing going,
until my product disappeared. I’m sure it was KARL, that
‘‘trou de fesse emmerd´e’’.
DMITRY
(To ALICE)
Write that down.
CLEMENT
How did you know about the cookies though? I bet ARYA
snitched on me, didn’t she? She always thinks she’s
better than everyone. And she can’t stand it when one
of her "friends" dances out of line. She always has to
force her help on you, whether you want it or not. I bet
she only tried to help KARL as well! You know, the night
he died, we played "hold hands with, marry, kill". Guess
who she chose to kill! Yea, KARL.
(EXIT CLEMENT, storming off.)
ALICE
(tries to call after CLEMENT)
Hey excuse me, we’ve still got a few questions here.
(silence)
I guess we’ll deal with that cookie issue later. But
wait a minute, you just went into his room, that’s not
33
allowed, is it?
(DMITRY shrugs it off with a smirk.)
DMITRY
Old police trick. Don’t tell the boss about it though.
We’d get desk duty for a week. In any case, we have a
new clue, don’t we? ARYA specifically said she wanted to
kill KARL.
ALICE
I guess you’re right, even if it was just only a game, it
is suspicious. But ARYA is just going to accuse CLEMENT
again, this seems like we’re running in circles.
DMITRY
Circles indeed. The truth is a puzzle, waiting to be
pieced together from its fragments.
(forms a circle with his hands)
Like a donut...
ALICE
If we’re not questioning ARYA, what about questioning
RAPHAEL? He seems the closest to KARL. While you were
gone, CLEMENT also said a weird thing, that someone else
found the body before him, and blackmailed him about
keeping his mouth shut. Maybe RAPHAEL knows something
about that.
DMITRY
Good call.
(EXIT DMITRY and ALICE.)
Scene 3.4: Gossip
CHARACTERS: ALICE, DMITRY, RAPHAEL, KARL, JEREMY
SETTING: Kitchen
(ENTER KARL.)
KARL
(to audience)
Man I’m tired. Did you know ghosts can’t sleep? I’ve
been staring at the ceiling for four nights straight.
Nothing like existential dread at night.
(ENTER ALICE, DMITRY, RAPHAEL.)
34
ALICE
We just have a couple more questions, if you don’t
mind.
RAPHAEL
Of course.
ALICE
Do you know if anyone found KARL’s body before CLEMENT
did?
RAPHAEL
(nervously)
What? I swear I already told you everything I know.
ALICE
(to DMITRY)
Do you think he was also threatened so he wouldn’t
talk?
DMITRY
Look son, just tell us! You don’t want to make this
situation any worse for yourself. We’ve got ways of
making people talk, and you don’t want to find out what
those are.
RAPHAEL
Okay okay, I’ll talk. JEREMY always gets up super
early to clean, you know. So of course he found the
body first. But before you two arrived, I found a note
in my room. It said that I would be next, if I said
anything.
ALICE
Are you sure it was JEREMY who left the note? It could
have been anyone. CLEMENT mentioned that ARYA said she
wanted to kill KARL, maybe she left the note?
RAPHAEL
That can’t be, ARYA is always just trying to look out for
all of us, you know. There was this one time though,
KARL had made a complete mess of the kitchen, like
always. No offence, but he was disgusting as hell most
of the time. And this one time, ARYA just lost it on
him. Afterwards she was really nice to him for a week, I
think she felt really bad about it.
DMITRY
35
You were convinced that JEREMY left the note, what made
you think that?
(KARL is speechless through all of
this, getting visibly upset.)
RAPHAEL
JEREMY is always so mean, but I feel like he doesn’t even
notice.
(gets emotional)
He doesn’t care about anyone’s feelings...
ALICE
(interjects)
I’m sure he tries.
RAPHAEL
(more and more emotional, until
crying)
No he doesn’t. I can’t believe that anyone would still
slut shame me in this day and age. All he thinks of
when he sees me is other people’s diseases- but I swear
I always use a fresh pair of gloves...
ALICE
(comforting)
Oh dear, I’m sorry. I’m sure he doesn’t mean it like
that.
RAPHAEL and KARL
Yes he does.
DMITRY
This is too much for me, I’m gonna go get a coffee or
something.
(EXIT DMITRY. RAPHAEL is still
sobbing. KARL is upset as well.)
(ENTER JEREMY.)
JEREMY
Hi guys.
(The others respond without
enthusiasm. JEREMY goes about his
business like everything is normal
for a bit, until he notices the
36
silence.)
JEREMY
Why are you all silent? Are you doing alright, with KARL
and everything?
RAPHAEL
(after a while)
No, I’m not. But you don’t care, do you?
JEREMY
Of course I care. You’re my friend.
RAPHAEL
(deep exhale)
But.. you’re always so.. You call me dirty all the
time. And not in the way I like. It hurts me, you know,
because it’s not true, but you really believe it, don’t
you?
JEREMY
I am just trying to help you RAPHAEL. And safety always
comes first.
KARL
Oh here we go...
RAPHAEL
(gets angry)
This is exactly what I’m talking about! You need to grow
up JEREMY!
JEREMY
Oh I need to grow up?! At least I know how to keep my
room clean!
RAPHAEL
And that’s all you care about, keeping your room
eeky-squeaky clean! Nothing gets in the way of you and
cleaning. Or should I say nobody gets in the way? Not
even KARL?
(KARL makes a horrified expression.)
JEREMY
I... I... What? You! I bet it was you all along! Did
KARL not want to play along anymore?
37
(KARL sits down like a lump of
sadness.)
ALICE
Hey, people... calm down. Let’s leave the hard
accusations to the police, will you? This is too much.
(The others ignore her. She sits
down next to KARL.)
Scene 3.5: The Arrest
CHARACTERS: ARYA, KARL, RAPHAEL, JEREMY, ALICE, DMITRY,
CLEMENT
SETTING: Kitchen
(RAPHAEL and JEREMY are in the middle
of their fight, KARL and ALICE are
sitting on the sofa.)
(ENTER ARYA.)
RAPHAEL
It was never like that and you know it!
JEREMY
I don’t want to know what it was like. I don’t even want
to imagine the things you do, and with whom.
ARYA
JEREMY!
JEREMY
Of course you’re on his side! Do you also think that I
did it?
RAPHAEL
That’s what we all think!
KARL
I think you don’t even care that I’m dead.
ARYA
RAPHAEL! I’m not on anyone’s side here. And will you two
please stop fighting for once?
KARL
No, they won’t. They never will.
38
ALICE
(to KARL)
Oh you’re too much, I can’t listen to you right now.
(she gets up and leaves)
(EXIT ALICE.
ENTER CLEMENT and DMITRY.)
CLEMENT
What was her problem?
JEREMY
Oh great, you’re here too. Did you come to accuse me as
well?
CLEMENT
Why would you say that?
RAPHAEL
Oh come on, you know it’s him, with his copied keys and
all. Who else could’ve done it?
(JEREMY, visibly distressed, maybe
crying, grabs a broom stick and acts
like he wants to hit RAPHAEL with
it.)
JEREMY
I can’t take it anymore. All of you! You are all wrong!
None of you understand me!
DMITRY
Hey! That’s enough. You are going to sleep at the
station tonight. We can’t have you assaulting your
roommates.
JEREMY
I don’t even care anymore.
(DMITRY puts JEREMY in handcuffs.)
DMITRY
You are under arrest, son.
JEREMY
And so what if I did it, hmm? You all hated KARL just as
much! I bet prison is better than this place anyways!
39
(Gasps from everyone but DMITRY.)
DMITRY
(leading JEREMY off stage)
Young man, anything you say can and will be used against
you.
(EXIT DMITRY, JEREMY.)
CLEMENT
Oh my god, it was him! I am so glad that they finally
got him. Just to think I was sleeping next door to a
killer. I need to go lie down.
(EXIT CLEMENT.)
RAPHAEL
(triumphantly)
I knew it!
(ARYA sits down on the floor, in
complete disbelief of what just
happened.)
ARYA
How can you be happy about this? Our friend got killed
and all we did was fight over it. We’re supposed to be
friends, who stick together. I thought we were a family.
(she storms off)
(EXIT ARYA.)
RAPHAEL
(chasing after her)
Hey wait, I’m sorry...
(EXIT RAPHAEL. Only KARL is left on
stage, looking sad and lonely.)
Scene 3.6: They wanted me dead
CHARACTERS: ALICE, KARL
SETTING: Kitchen
(KARL is alone on stage, sad and
unsatisfied. He thinks that
everybody hates him.
ENTER ALICE)
40
ALICE
Hey, why are you still here? We solved it. He
confessed, didn’t he?
KARL
(sad, looking at the floor)
Yes... We solved it.
ALICE
(sighs, surprised that KARL is sad)
Cheer up. Wasn’t this what you wanted? Your unfinished
business is finished?
KARL
You’re starting to sound like DMITRY. Everything for the
truth.
ALICE
Thank you.
KARL
It wasn’t a compliment.
ALICE
I should go back and discuss with the boss. So...
(ALICE turns around to leave the room
but KARL continues with his suffering
and ALICE stops to listen to what he
has more to add.)
ALICE
Yes?
KARL
(mumbling)
No one likes me.
ALICE
(slightly annoyed)
I’m sorry?
KARL
You know, it could’ve been anyone. And everyone.
(pauses)
Even ARYA, who was always looking out for me.
ALICE
41
Well, it wasn’t "everyone". That would’ve been absurd.
KARL
But that’s not the point! Do you not understand? I
liked these people! I cared about them! And they never
even - They could’ve wanted to...
(ALICE is done with his complaining
and bursts out to KARL.)
ALICE
Oh please... just shut up for once, will you? All
you’ve done is complain and make things more complicated.
You haven’t helped me at all. I thought being able to
talk to you would make it easier to solve this case. But
all you’ve been doing is just nagging and nagging and
complaining and - And do you know how much help that’s
been?
KARL
(tries to stop ALICE)
Please listen!
ALICE
No! I’m done listening to you! This is my first
murdercase. This is everything I have worked for. And
it will be my only case if you keep trying to mess it up
for me.
KARL
THEY WANTED ME DEAD! All of them. All of them hated me.
JEREMY was right.
ALICE
No wonder they wanted you dead! I even want to kill you
myself right now!
KARL
(takes a breath of air such as he
prepares to say something but stops
and says nothing)
ALICE
But oh, I guess I can’t do that because you ARE already
dead! I’m just saying, maybe you shouldn’t be that
surprised. Now leave me alone and let me finish this
case the right way. Without someone dead constantly
distracting me.
42
KARL
You’re nothing like I thought you’d be.
(EXIT KARL. Fade to black.)
ACT 4: Everything becomes clear
Scene 4.1: Everyone killed him
CHARACTERS: ARYA, CLEMENT, RAPHAEL
SETTING: Kitchen
(ARYA enters the kitchen looking
around to make sure no one can
see her. Checks under the couch,
grabbing a box of rat poison.)
ARYA
Buf! I can’t believe it worked, how did no one find
this?
(Evil laughter)
This was waay too easy.
(EXIT ARYA.
ENTER CLEMENT, opens the cupboard and
takes out a small pouch of cookies.)
CLEMENT
They’re still here! Good thing no one ate the extra
special cookies I made just for KARL.
(Evil laughter)
This was waay too easy.
(EXIT CLEMENT.
ENTER RAPHAEL, grabs one of the jars
from the cabinet.)
RAPHAEL
(Looking at the audience.)
What? You all thought I was innocent? Well, I had my
reasons.
(Evil laughter)
This was waay too easy.
(EXIT RAPHAEL.)
43
Scene 4.2: The Autopsy Results
CHARACTERS: ALICE, DMITRY, KARL
SETTING: Kitchen
(DMITRY is in the kitchen grabbing
some coffee. ALICE comes in with a
paper in her hands.)
ALICE
We finally got the autopsy results.
DMITRY
Let me see.
(grabs the paper from her hands
before she can read, and starts
reading)
The decedent appears to be a young male, bla bla, no
signs of external trauma or injury were observed, okay,
significant evidence of acute gastritis and hemorrhagic
inflammation observed... What is that supposed to
mean?
ALICE
Let me
(grabs the paper)
Blood: Elevated levels of Staphylococcus aureus
(struggles to pronounce this)
were detected.
(reads through the paper)
wait, here it is! Conclusion:
(DMITRY looks over at the paper and
both start reading)
Both
(surprised, looking at each other)
It can’t be!
DMITRY
I need to call the doctor to make sure there was no
mistake.
(pauses to stretch his back)
I’m telling you, this case really took it out of me. I’m
not the young guy I used to be.
(pause)
I think I gotta start thinking about retirement.
(takes the paper and leaves the room)
44
(EXIT DMITRY.
ENTER KARL. ALICE is still visibly
shocked. It is obvious that KARL has
been crying while he was out of the
room.)
KARL
(sniff)
hey, you look as if you just saw a ghost ha ha.
(ALICE is still not responding)
ALICE? AaaALICE hellooo
(waves his hand in front of her)
is anyone there??
ALICE
(finally looking at KARL)
Oh my god KARL, we’ve been so wrong, we have to fix this.
I need to go
(leaves the room leaving KARL alone
and visibly confused)
Scene 4.3: Remember KARL
CHARACTERS: ARYA, RAPHAEL, CLEMENT, JEREMY, KARL
SETTING: Kitchen
(KARL is alone in the kitchen, he
sits on the counter.
ENTER ARYA, RAPHAEL, CLEMENT.)
ARYA
I still can’t believe they took JEREMY away...
CLEMENT
Yeah I can’t believe it either.
(everyone looks at her surprised)
RAPHAEL
It’s not like I liked the guy that much, but he might
spend the rest of his life in prison...
CLEMENT
Yes, things got a bit too real. It’s not like he
disliked KARL more than we did.
ARYA
Come on, it’s not like KARL was always that bad.
Remember last year when we threw the halloween party and
45
someone came as Cruella de Ville with a real dog and left
it here? KARL took care of it the whole next day until
its owner came to pick it up.
RAPHAEL
True! He was always good with non-human animals. I also
remember that one time I told him I wanted a bouquet as
a token of his appreciation. But instead of flowers, he
accidentally ordered a bouquet of broccoli.
CLEMENT
I remember! He organised a dinner for the whole corridor
with that broccoli and decided to make the "Broccoli
Bouquet Banquet" a yearly thing. That was nice, even
though ARYA is the one who always ends up cooking and
cleaning for it. I’m gonna miss that crazy absurd mess
of a person.
(All are visibly sad and reminiscent
of the good old times.
ENTER JEREMY.)
ARYA
(sees JEREMY)
Oh my god, JEREMY!
(runs to him and hugs him)
did they let you go?!
JEREMY
Yes, apparently they found proof that I wasn’t the
killer. They didn’t tell me much else, but apparently
it wasn’t a murder at all.
RAPHAEL
What? So none of us is a killer?
CLEMENT
(almost fainting)
Oh what a relief!
RAPHAEL
So, they’re letting you go just like that?
JEREMY
Yeah, they apologised for the confusion, and my
lawyer made sure they compensated me for the wrongful
accusations.

CLEMENT
(teary-eyed)
It’s been a tough few days, JEREMY. We were just
reminiscing about the good times we had with KARL.
ARYA
Remember the Broccoli Bouquet Banquet?
JEREMY
Oh true! Those were some crazy times.
(pauses)
I wish I had appreciated them more when KARL was
around.
(They all hug as KARL is tearing up.
EXIT CLEMENT and JEREMY.)
(RAPHAEL and ARYA sit on the couch
together.)
RAPHAEL
I’ve been thinking. I love holding hands with you and
all,
(pause)
but maybe would you like to go on a real date some
time?
ARYA
(gives RAPHAEL a perplexed look)
I thought you didn’t do "real dates".
RAPHAEL
I don’t. But maybe I want to.
(pause)
Life can be shorter than you think and I don’t want to
regret anything in the afterlife.
ARYA
Aww.
RAPHAEL
(a bit anxiously)
Sooo?
ARYA
Yes I think I’d like that.
(EXIT RAPHAEL and ARYA.)

Scene 4.4: KARL’s Monologue
CHARACTERS: KARL
SETTING: Kitchen
(KARL is on stage by himself.)
KARL
Wow, here I am. I really didn’t expect that. I guess
those two do make a cute couple. And I’m so glad that
they released JEREMY, he would have never made it in
prison. But yea... so none of them killed me.
(walks around the kitchen while
talking, pensative)
To be honest, I really had myself convinced that everyone
hated me. I wouldn’t have blamed them for killing me. I
was a terrible roommate. But really, I’m happy to have
had them in my life, all of them. I was always afraid
of being forgotten, but now I finally see the difference
I made in everyone’s lives. So, as I stand here, on the
brink of whatever comes next, I’m filled with gratitude.
Gratitude for the connections, for the love, and yes,
even for the heartache. Because it all meant something.
It all mattered. And with that, I think I’m ready to go
to on the other side.
(Closes his eyes and takes his
lift-off pose.)
Why is this not working?
(Tries again, from a different
position.)
Scene 4.5: Break The Rules
CHARACTERS: ALICE, KARL
SETTING: Kitchen
(KARL is in the Kitchen by himself
after his monologue.
ENTER ALICE.)
ALICE
You look happy.
KARL
You too - Hey, you never told me how I actually died, did
you?
ALICE
48
Do you remember when you told me about how you would just
add pasta to food that had gone bad and then you would
eat it?
KARL
Sure.
ALICE
The autopsy report said it was severe food poisoning.
(They both fall into a good laugh
about it.)
ALICE
So, now that you know - your unfinished business is -
KARL
I don’t know. I’m happy. But I’m also scared.
ALICE
Do you know what happens next?
KARL
I have no idea. Honestly, I don’t want to go now. I
wanted to before. But now I feel like - I’ll even miss
talking to you. It’s kind of cool to be a secret ghost
sidekick. It’s cooler than anything I did when I was
alive.
ALICE
Can’t you stay then?
KARL
I don’t know, it kind of seems like breaking the rules.
I’m only here because I had unfinished business, right?
ALICE
Sure, but who says you can’t break the rules? What do
you have to lose?
KARL
Okay, I guess you’re right. But what would I do? I
can’t talk to anyone but you. I’d just be your sidekick
forever.
ALICE
Not sidekick, but how about partner? Detective KARL.
We could solve all kinds of mysteries together. We’d be
49
unstoppable.
KARL
Detective KARL. I like that.
(Fade to black.)
